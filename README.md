# Evolving Climbers: Advanced Genetic Algorithm for Mountain-Climbing Creatures

This repository contains a high-performance implementation of a modular genetic algorithm designed to evolve virtual creatures capable of climbing complex 3D terrain. The work was completed as Part B of the CM3020 Artificial Intelligence coursework and includes over 4,999 lines of professional-grade Python code, systematic experimentation across 35+ configurations, and breakthrough results in evolutionary robotics.

## üìà Genetic Decoding Strategies

- **Motor Control Only**: Oscillatory patterns, fixed morphology
- **Body Shape Only**: Limb design evolution, fixed movement
- **Partial Evolution**: Targeted limb/torso mutation
- **Modular Evolution**: Evolving functional modules independently
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balanced tradeoffs between stability, performance, and efficiency
- **Hybrid Evolution**: Dynamic strategy switching during run-time
